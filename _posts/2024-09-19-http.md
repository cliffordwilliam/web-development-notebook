## Introduction

This page introduces basic concepts of the HTTP protocol. This is the foundation to learn how web application works.

Web browsers serve as interfaces to the World Wide Web, which operates on top of the internet infrastructure. When you type a URL address into a browser's **address bar**, you're making a request for resources from a web server. In this interaction, your browser is the **client** requesting data from **servers**.

The server's response can be:
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Videos
- Images
- And much more

Responses can take many forms. For responses in form of "page", it is actually "painted" by your browser. The painting instructions are 1 or more of the above listed responses.

To facilitate data exchange between machines, we rely on **protocols**—standardized rules or agreements that must be followed. Different contexts require different protocols. This page focuses on **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), invented by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s. **HTTP governs the transfer of hypertext documents**. A hypertext document is any file that contains links to other files, meaning it doesn't apply solely to web pages—files like markdowns also qualify as hypertext.

> "Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access."  
— *Wikipedia*, [Hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)

In HTTP, the client makes a request and waits for a response. This makes HTTP a **request-response** protocol. The purpose of such a protocol is to ensure that both the client and the server have a mutual understanding of what to expect in terms of requests and responses, enabling smooth communication between them.

### A Brief History of HTTP

Initially, HTTP only supported HTML. In 1992, HTTP/1.0 was introduced, allowing the transmission of additional content types such as CSS, videos, scripts, and images. In 1995, HTTP/1.1 was released, enabling the reuse of established connections for subsequent requests, improving efficiency. Currently, HTTP/3 is in development.

### IP Addresses and Port Numbers

In a network, each device, or **node**, is assigned a unique private **IP address** by its router. When connected to the internet, your device is assigned a public IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). 

Each connection also uses a **port number**. Think of port numbers as different rooms that specific applications or services on a device use to communicate. For example, your printer may use a specific port, while web servers and other applications each occupy their own.

An IP address looks like this: `192.168.0.1`

```
192.168.0.1
```

When paired with a port number, it would look like this: `192.168.0.1:1234`

```
192.168.0.1:1234
```
